# Fritolay Attrition Prediction

This project investigates the key factors contributing to employee attrition within the organization, aiming to identify patterns that can inform retention strategies and reduce hiring costs. Using a dataset of 870 employees and 36 variables, we examined a mix of demographic, role-based, and behavioral factors to understand their relationship with employee turnover.

## Key Findings:
- High Attrition in Sales: Sales Representatives consistently show the highest attrition rates, indicating potential issues within this role that may require targeted retention efforts.

- Influence of Overtime: Employees who work overtime, particularly Research Scientists, are more likely to leave. This suggests that managing workload could be a critical factor in reducing attrition.

- Impact of Tenure and Management Stability: Tenure-related variables, such as Years at Company and Years with Current Manager, show strong negative correlations with attrition. Employees with longer tenures and stable management are less likely to leave, highlighting the importance of consistent leadership and growth opportunities.

- Role of Job Satisfaction: Although job satisfaction is linked to lower attrition, its effect is relatively weak. While important, it may not be a strong predictor on its own.

## Modeling Approach: 
To enhance predictive accuracy, we selected key features such as Role, Overtime, Tenure, and Job Satisfaction. We also considered other runner-up variables, like Years Since Last Promotion, to further strengthen the model if needed.

## Conclusion and Recommendations: 
The analysis points to specific areas of opportunity to improve retention, especially within the Sales department and for employees frequently working overtime. Implementing strategies to balance workload and provide career development opportunities may help mitigate attrition. By leveraging these insights, DDSAnalytics can make data-driven decisions to foster a more stable and engaged workforce.
